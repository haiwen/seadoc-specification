# Paragraph

Paragraph type nodes are basic content nodes to present inline text. Paragraph nodes act as the foundational block for textual content and support a variety of inline formatting.

Paragraph nodes contain a `text` node that displays the actual text content.

## Node structure example
```javascript  
{
  "id": "afLKcmNdR4ii2ZqvH8PP8w",
  "type": "paragraph",
  "children": [
    {
    "id": "bKfw6ms4QlqUf1J5aFCr4w",
    "text": "text content"
    }
  ]
}
```
